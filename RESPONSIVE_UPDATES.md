# Responsive Design Updates

## Overview
The website has been made fully responsive across all pages to provide an optimal viewing experience on devices of all sizes - from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## Critical Fix: Width Management
All fixed `width: 1440px` declarations have been replaced with flexible widths:
- Changed to `width: 100%; max-width: 1600px;`
- Added `left: 0; right: 0; margin: 0 auto;` for proper centering
- This ensures content never exceeds viewport width while maintaining design integrity on large screens
- Maximum width set to 1600px for better viewing on modern large displays

## Breakpoints

The following breakpoints have been implemented:

- **Desktop Large**: > 1600px (max-width container)
- **Desktop**: 1440px and below
- **Tablet**: 992px and below
- **Mobile**: 768px and below
- **Mobile Small**: 480px and below

## Browser Compatibility

The responsive design uses standard CSS media queries and properties that are widely supported:

- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Testing Recommendations

3. Optimize image loading with responsive images (srcset)
4. Add animation transitions between breakpoints
5. Implement progressive web app features

## Notes

- All changes are made purely in CSS
- No JavaScript modifications required
- Original design maintained for desktop users
- Mobile-first approach for future development recommended
