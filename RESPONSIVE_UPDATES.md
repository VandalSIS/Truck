# Responsive Design Updates

## Overview
The website has been made fully responsive across all pages to provide an optimal viewing experience on devices of all sizes - from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

**Inspired by:** [ViviaVerde Moldova](https://vivaverde-moldova-bloom.vercel.app/) - implemented smooth transitions, fluid layouts, and modern responsive design patterns.

## Critical Fix: Width Management
All fixed `width: 1440px` declarations have been replaced with flexible widths:
- Changed to `width: 100%; max-width: 1600px;`
- Added `left: 0; right: 0; margin: 0 auto;` for proper centering
- This ensures content never exceeds viewport width while maintaining design integrity on large screens
- Maximum width set to 1600px for better viewing on modern large displays

## Breakpoints

The following breakpoints have been implemented with smooth transitions:

- **Desktop Large**: > 1600px (max-width container, fluid layout)
- **Desktop**: ≤ 1600px (fully responsive containers)
- **Desktop Medium**: ≤ 1440px (adjusted typography, smooth scaling)
- **Tablet Large**: ≤ 1200px (2-column layouts)
- **Tablet**: ≤ 992px (single column for services)
- **Mobile**: ≤ 768px (optimized mobile experience)
- **Mobile Small**: ≤ 480px (compact typography)

## Browser Compatibility

The responsive design uses standard CSS media queries and properties that are widely supported:
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Testing Recommendations

3. Optimize image loading with responsive images (srcset)
4. Add animation transitions between breakpoints
5. Implement progressive web app features

## Notes

- No JavaScript modifications required
- Original design maintained for desktop users
- Mobile-first approach for future development recommended
